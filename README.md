### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Charles here!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Debian packaging and translation, building a homepage for myself, researching Defensive Security for my final year thesis, planning the GELOS' and Ganesh's onboarding projects, ... (for things that I'm forgeting :-)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning InfoSec, Advanced Python, SysAdmin, ... (forgeting things is kind of my thing)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything I can on the free software community
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning new and interesting things (Hackaday is an awesome place to discover these, but I'm running out of tabs)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything really
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: charlesmelara [ a t ] riseup [ d o t ] net (hopefully bots will miss this)
